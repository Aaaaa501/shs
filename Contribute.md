# Student contributors needed to maintain stevenson.space

stevenson.space was created in 2016 and has been a student-run project ever since. The site doesn't run itself and requires constant maintenance, bug fixes and upgrades only made possible by its contributors. Unknown to many, the code for the website is [open-sourced](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) and the opportunity to contribute to the website is extended to Stevenson students. We are currently looking for new contributors. 


The Spring semester of 2022 will provide crucial experience to underclassmen who are interested in being committed to contributing to all the major functions of the site into the future - we will call this group of person(s) "committed contributors" (no git pun intended). The work of "committed contributors" includes updating lunch menus, schedules, themes, holiday messages, and fixing bugs that arise in our systems. Be advised that being a "committed contributor" is a significant time commitment and responsibility. If you are interested in being this person(s), read to the end.

Those who are not interested in being "committed contributors", are still able to contribute to the site through Github. These contributions may include bug fixes or new features. To anybody interested in computer science, feel free to clone the code, and tinker with it on your computer.

## Technical Overview
stevenson.space uses the following languages/technologies

- Github
- Vue.js + VueX, SASS, ESlint
- Node.js
- Typescript
- Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Netlify CI/CD builds
- Google OAth 2.0

# I'm interested in CS but not technically able to contribute anything
We understand, there is a lot of code involved with the site (over 10,000 lines of it) and it's not something that can be learned overnight. We encourage anybody interested in CS to take the time to learn more on their own time and attempt at contributing something to the site. There is an endless number of free internet resources available to learn the skills necessary to run stevenson.space if that's something you would like to pursue.
