# Student contributors needed to maintain Stevenson.Space

![](./public/static/ repovisualization.png "Repository Visualization")


Stevenson.Space was created in 2016 and has been a student run project ever since. The site doesn't run itself and requires constant maintenece, bug fixes and upgrades only made possible by it's contributers. Unknown to many, the code for the website is open-sourced (publically available) and the oppertunity to contribute to the website is extended to the entire Stevenson community. We are currently looking for new contributers. 


The spring Semester of 2022 will provide crucial experience to underclassmen who are interested in consistantly contributing to all the major function of the site into the future. This work includes updating lunch menus, schedules, themes, holiday messages and fixing bugs that arise in our systems. Being a consistant contributer is significant time commitment, even for relatively experienced developers. 

Those who are not up to the commitment of being a committed contributer, are still able to contribute to the site with no bureaucratic barriers to entry through Github. 

## Technical Oveview
Stevenson.Space uses the following languages/technologies

- Github
- Vue.js + VueX, SASS, ESlint
- Node.js
- Typescript
- Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Netlify CI/CD builds
- Google OAth 2.0

*Note: If you know Javascript, HTML and CSS well, you will be close to being able to work with Vue. Also React, Nuxt, Gatsby, and other JS frameworks are quite similar to Vue.js. Node.js and Typescript are forms of Javascript.*
