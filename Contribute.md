# Student contributors needed to maintain stevenson.space

stevenson.space was created in 2016 and has been a student-run project ever since. The site doesn't run itself and requires constant maintenance, bug fixes and upgrades only made possible by its contributors. Unknown to many, the code for the website is [open-sourced](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) and the opportunity to contribute to the website is extended to Stevenson students. We are currently looking for new contributors. 


The Spring semester of 2022 will provide crucial experience to underclassmen who are interested in consistently contributing to all the major functions of the site into the future. This work includes updating lunch menus, schedules, themes, holiday messages, and fixing bugs that arise in our systems. Be advised that being a consistent contributor is a significant time commitment.

Those who are not interested in being a committed contributor, are still able to contribute to the site through Github. These contributions may include bug fixes or new features. To anybody interested in computer science, feel free to clone the code, and tinker with it on your own computer.

## Technical Overview
stevenson.space uses the following languages/technologies

- Github
- Vue.js + VueX, SASS, ESlint
- Node.js
- Typescript
- Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Netlify CI/CD builds
