    <h1>Annoucement Regarding Documents</h1>
    <p>Recently, we were contacted by administration regarding the textbooks available on our Documents page.
    We were informed that the page must be taken down immediately. As of now, the <a href="docs.html">page</a> is <strong>no longer available.</strong>
    We will be contacting administration to work out a possible solution in order to provide the books digitally as a convenience to students, rather than an intention to break the law.</p>
