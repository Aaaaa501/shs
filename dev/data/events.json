According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, parents remain the No. 1 influence on their child&rsquo;s decision not to drink alcohol or use drugs. SAMHSA has lots of resources for parents at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.samhsa.gov/underage-drinking\">http://www.samhsa.gov/underage-drinking</a>. Plus, Stevenson&rsquo;s Prevention Team recently rolled out its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.standstrongcoalition.com/latest-news\">&ldquo;Your Brain-Gray Matters&rdquo; campaign</a>&nbsp;to inform students about the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.d125.org/docs/default-source/student-services-documents/substance-abuse-prevention-program/addiction-and-the-brain.pdf?sfvrsn=2\">harmful effects of alcohol and drugs on the teenage brain</a>, which continues to develop until around age 21.</p>\n<p>Stand Strong also has tips on its website at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.standstrongcoalition.com/\">standstrongcoalition.com</a>&nbsp;for parents who might be hosting a party, or whose student is going to a party. Look under the Parent/Social Hosting tab for suggestions on how to ensure an alcohol- and drug-free party (such as encouraging small parties that are by invitation only); checking your entire home prior to the party, including outside of the house and removable ceiling tiles; and making sure an adult chaperone is present and visible throughout the party.</p>\n</div>-->"
