The assessments are Wednesday and Thursday, Jan. 29-30, from 4:15-7:30 p.m. Attendance both days is required. Dancers should wear what they would wear at their studio for any technique class. Generally dancers wear: yoga/jazz pants, leggings, bootie shorts, or tights on the bottom and leotard or dance tank on top. Hair needs to be well secured off the face. No jewelry. Only bare feet or paws are acceptable. Wearing all black is   not   suggested. We often can decipher students by distinctive colors, hair items, etc. Please do not be extreme or purchase anything new. Just keep in mind we are trying to memorize 90 or so new faces. We also ask that dancers wash the clothing and wear it again on Thursday. This helps us to remember the students more accurately.\n\nWhen arriving, please enter through parking lot E and proceed in through the Sports Center doors. The assessment will take place in Dance Studio (Room 2010). This is on the second floor behind the Sports Center.

Many parents' lives are rushed to the point that we are never fully here because we're always worrying about the next thing on the to-do list. We get stressed and anxious, easily provoked by our children into unhelpful reactions, instead of responding in a more considered way. Join Ramaa Krishna to learn how to slow down, and give space for some 'being' instead of always 'doing'. We will practice how to set aside a few minutes each day for mindfulness practice. As we allow mindfulness to seep into the rest of our daily life, we will find that we can approach parenting in a more mindful way.\n  \n  Registration requested at:\n\n https://www.eventbrite.com/e/mindfulness-for-paren...",
