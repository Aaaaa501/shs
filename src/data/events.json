Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago to address the emotional, social and spiritual needs of hospitalized children and their families. These programs include art therapy, recreation, tutoring, preparation for medical procedures, family resources, culturally appropriate care, pastoral care, bereavement counseling and much more. Learn more about K.I.D.S.S. for Kids at  http://kidssforkids.org .\n    \n KAN-WIN:  This group's mission is to eradicate all forms of violence against women, including domestic violence and sexual assault, by empowering Asian-American survivors and engaging the community through culturally competent services, community education and outreach, and advocacy. KAN-WIN's services are designed to empower immigrant survivors to tackle the unique and complex challenges they face and transition from crisis to long-term empowerment. Through intensive wrap around services, KAN-WIN strives to provide a one-stop shop for survivors to minimize the risk of chasing for help. Learn more about KAN-WIN at  www.kanwin.org .\n    \n Turning the Page:  This non-profit links public schools, families and communities to ensure students receive valuable educational resources and a high-quality public education. Turning the Page, founded in Washington D.C. in 1998, features Carpe Librum (\"seize the book\") pop-up book stores that sell gently used books, CDs, DVDs, and records, with the profits supporting the program's initiatives. In 2015, Turning the Page expanded its operations to Chicago's North Lawndale neighborhood. Learn more about Turning the Page at  https://turningthepage.org .",
