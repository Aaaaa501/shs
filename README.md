Beautiful and practical agenda management tool for SHS students

## Feature Ideas
- Print Bonanza - Information on all the (student available) printers in the school, their features, location, picture cutouts of what they look like, display name, notes ect.
- Allow people to add Custom Links to the Links Page
- Allow people to make their own themes on the site and submit them for review for possible uploading.
- Add all the Jazzmans and other food items to a more detailed menus page

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Setting up your .env file
Duplicate the `.env-template` and rename the duplicate to `.env`. This will keep the template, and give you a personal development environment that won't get commited to github.
